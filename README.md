📄AGRIBOTHO SIMULATED SENSOR DASHBOARD

ℹ️PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The dashboard simulates environmental data that a farmer would monitor and control for the optimal growth of the crop planted in a greenhouse. It was built as a way to prepare for later advancements of connecting to IoT devices and real life data as it would be the central control for the controls and the environmental data. Temperature, humidity, soil moisture and light level were the variables monitored and controlled.
